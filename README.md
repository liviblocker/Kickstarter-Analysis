# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play <i>Fever</i> came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. The purpose of this project is to compare how different Kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. By looking at the campaign launch dates of 1369 theatre projects and the campaign funding goals of 1047 plays, we were able to determine the optimum months to launch a campaign and the ideal funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this analysis, we looked at 1369 campaigns for theatre projects, including plays, musicals, and spaces. Of the 1369 theatre campaigns, 839 (61%) were successful, 493 (36%) failed, and only 37 (3%) were canceled.

In general, most of the campaigns were launched in May and June. 111 successful campaigns were launched in May, more than any other month. While May was also the launch date of the most failed campaigns, there was less variation in the number of failed campaigns from month to month. That pattern can be seen in the graph below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When initially analyzing the outcomes based on goals, the percentages were coming out weird. I had to change the boundaries of the "Goals" in the formula to incorporate ">=" as opposed to ">".

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
