# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise’s play <i>Fever<i/> came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Louise The purpose of this project is to compare how different Kickstarter campaigns

 Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When initially analyzing the outcomes based on goals, the percentages were coming out weird. I had to change the boundaries of the "Goals" in the formula to incorporate ">=" as opposed to ">".

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
